Project Report: Image Classification using RNN.
1. Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning labels to images based on their content. In this project, we developed an image classification system using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to accurately classify images into different categories such as cats, dogs, and pandas. The project aimed to address various challenges, including handling corrupted images, overcoming overfitting issues, and optimizing the model's performance through hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner.

2. Handling Corrupted Images
Corrupted images can negatively impact the training process and model performance. Therefore, it was crucial to detect and remove corrupted images from the dataset. This was achieved by implementing a mechanism that analyzed the images' metadata or quality metrics to identify corrupted or unreadable images. The pros and cons of handling corrupted images are as follows:
Pros:
Improved training quality: By removing corrupted images, we ensured that the model was trained on clean and reliable data, leading to better performance.
Reduced model bias: Removing corrupted images helped to avoid biases that could arise from inaccurate or misleading data, resulting in more accurate and unbiased predictions.
Cons:
Loss of data: Removing corrupted images may result in a loss of valuable data, reducing the overall size of the dataset and potentially limiting the model's ability to generalize.

3. Overcoming Overfitting with Data Augmentation
Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. To address this issue, data augmentation techniques were employed. Data augmentation involves applying various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing training images, creating additional synthetic training samples. The pros and cons of data augmentation are as follows:
Pros:
Increased training data: Data augmentation expanded the size of the training dataset, providing more diverse examples for the model to learn from and reducing the risk of overfitting.
Improved generalization: By exposing the model to different variations of the images, data augmentation improved the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions on unseen data.


Cons:
Increased computational requirements: Applying data augmentation techniques during training increased the computational resources needed, as each augmented image required additional processing time.
Potential introduction of synthetic artifacts: In some cases, aggressive data augmentation techniques could introduce synthetic artifacts that differ from the characteristics of real images, potentially affecting the model's performance.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning using Keras Tuner
Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned by the model during training, but rather set by the user. These parameters can significantly impact the model's performance. In this project, hyperparameter tuning was performed using Keras Tuner, which automates the process of searching for the optimal hyperparameters. The pros and cons of hyperparameter tuning are as follows:
Pros:
Improved performance: Hyperparameter tuning helped to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters, leading to improved model performance in terms of accuracy and generalization.
Efficient resource utilization: By automating the search for optimal hyperparameters, Keras Tuner saved time and computational resources compared to manual trial-and-error approaches.
Cons:
Increased complexity: Hyperparameter tuning adds an extra layer of complexity to the model development process. It requires careful consideration of various hyperparameters and their interactions, which can be time-consuming and challenging.
Increased computational requirements: Hyperparameter tuning involves training and evaluating multiple models with different hyperparameter settings, which can significantly increase the computational resources required.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the Image Classification using RNN project addressed several challenges in image classification. By handling corrupted images and employing data augmentation techniques, the model's performance and generalization ability were improved. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using Keras Tuner optimized the model's hyperparameters, resulting in enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
Through the project, we demonstrated the importance of handling corrupted images to maintain data quality, the benefits of data augmentation in overcoming overfitting, and the significance of hyperparameter tuning for achieving optimal model performance. The project contributes to the field of computer vision by providing an effective image classification system using RNNs and highlighting the importance of preprocessing steps and parameter optimization.
While the project showcased positive outcomes, it is important to consider the trade-offs involved, such as potential data loss in removing corrupted images and increased complexity and computational requirements in data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning. These trade-offs should be carefully evaluated based on the specific project requirements and constraints.
Overall, the Image Classification using RNN project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in solving real-world problems and lays the foundation for further advancements in the field of computer vision.
